# SOLID Principles Implementation - User Login/Signup Service

Welcome to the repository for the assignment given during the BO phase of the training program at Experion Technologies. The focus of this assignment was to implement a service within a selected domain while adhering to the SOLID principles.

## Domain: User Login/Signup Service

### Assignment Overview

The goal of the assignment was to choose a domain as a team and have each team member implement a service within that domain. I chose to work on the user login/signup section.

### SOLID Principles

The implemented code in this repository strictly follows the SOLID principles. These principles are a set of five design principles that promote maintainability, flexibility, and scalability in software development. Here's how each principle is applied:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
   - Each class and module in the codebase has a single responsibility, making the code more maintainable and focused.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
   - The code is designed to be open for extension but closed for modification. This promotes the addition of new features without changing existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
   - Subtypes can be substituted for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. This ensures a smooth inheritance hierarchy.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
   - Interfaces are specific to the needs of the clients that use them. This prevents classes from being forced to implement interfaces they do not use.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
   - High-level modules (e.g., business logic) are not dependent on low-level modules (e.g., database access). Both depend on abstractions.
